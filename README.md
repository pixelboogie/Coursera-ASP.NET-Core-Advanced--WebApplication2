# Coursera-ASP.NET-Core-Advanced--WebApplication2

## Description
This project is part of the Coursera course for the ".NET FullStack Developer Specialization" certification. The focus of this project is to demonstrate the use of scaffolding templates in ASP.NET Core MVC applications to streamline the development process, particularly for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

In this project, you will create a model class (e.g., `User`) and use ASP.NET Core's scaffolding feature to automatically generate the DbContext, controller, and views needed for CRUD operations. The scaffolding templates allow you to save time by generating much of the necessary code automatically, rather than manually writing it yourself.

The project also emphasizes the importance of dependency injection for creating a loosely coupled architecture. The DbContext is injected into the controller via the constructor, allowing for better maintainability and testability of the code. The connection string is managed in the `appsettings.json` file and injected into the DbContext using the `AddDbContext` method in the `Program.cs` file.

This approach not only simplifies the development process but also ensures that your application is built following best practices in modern web development.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM and database management, including code-first and database-first approaches.
- **C#**: Programming language used in the project.
- **Scaffolding Templates**: Feature in ASP.NET Core to auto-generate code for controllers, views, and DbContext.
- **Dependency Injection**: Technique to inject dependencies into classes, promoting loose coupling.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Coursera-ASP.NET-Core-Advanced--WebApplication2.git
   cd Coursera-ASP.NET-Core-Advanced--WebApplication2


2. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed. Then, restore any required packages:

        dotnet restore


3. **Configure the Database:**

    Update the appsettings.json file with your database connection string.


4. **Run Migrations:**
    If needed, apply migrations to create the database and tables:

        dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
        dotnet ef database update


5. **Run the Application:**
    Start the application using the following command:

        dotnet run


## Usage ##
    Once the application is running, you can perform CRUD operations on the User entity through the web interface. The application demonstrates how to use scaffolding to generate the necessary components for interacting with the database efficiently.
